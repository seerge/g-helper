## Open source Armoury Crate alternative for Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, G15, Flow X13, Flow X16, and other models

A small utility that allows you to do almost everything you could do with Armoury Crate but without extra bloat and unnecessary services.

### :gift: Main advantages 

1. Seamless and automatic GPU switching (without asking you to close all apps, etc)
2. All performance modes can be fully customized (with fan curves and PPTs)
3. Very lightweight and consumes almost no resources, doesn't install any services. Just a single exe to run

### [:floppy_disk: Download latest release](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper/releases/latest/download/GHelper.zip)

If you like this app, please [star :star: it on Github](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper) and spread a word about it!

### :zap: Main features

1. Built-in **Performance modes**: Silent - Balanced - Turbo (with default fan curves)
2. **GPU modes**: Eco - Standard - Ultimate - Optimized
3. Laptop screen refresh rate 60hz or 120hz (144hz, etc depending on the model) with display overdrive (OD)
4. Default and custom fan profiles for every performance mode
5. Power limits (PPT) for every performance mode
6. CPU turbo boost mode
7. Keyboard backlit animation and colors
8. Anime matrix control thanks to [Starlight](https://github.com/vddCore/Starlight) + some tweaks from my side (including animated GIFs)
9. FN+F5 cycles performance modes, FN+F4 cycles keyboard animation modes
10. Keybindings for M3 and M4 keys
11. Battery charge limit to preserve battery health
12. Monitor CPU / GPU temperature, fan speeds and battery discharge rate

### :apple: Automatic switching of modes when on battery or plugged in
- Performance modes (app remembers last mode used on battery or when plugged)
- Optimized GPU mode - disables dGPU on battery and enables when plugged
- Auto Screen refresh rate (60hz on battery, 120+ hz when plugged)

To keep auto switching and hotkeys working the app needs to stay in running in the tray. It doesn't consume any resources. 

### :rocket: Performance Modes

Modes are **same** as in Armory Crate (as they are stored in bios), including default fan curves

1. Silent (minimal or no fans, 70W PPT total, up to 45W PPT to CPU) + Best power efficiency setting in windows
2. Balanced (balanced fans, 100W PPT total, up to 45W PPT to CPU) + Balanced setting in windows
3. Turbo (intense fans, 125W PPT total, up to 80W PPT to CPU) + Best performance setting in windows

PPTs are shown for G14 2022, for other models PPTs will be different as they are set in bios.

### :video_game: GPU Modes

1. Eco mode : only low power integrated GPU enabled, iGPU drives built in display
2. Standard mode (Windows Hybrid) : iGPU and dGPU enabled, iGPU drives built in display
3. Ultimate mode: iGPU and dGPU enabled, but dGPU drives built in display (supported only on G14 2022 model)
4. Optimized (formely existed as a checkbox): disables dGPU on battery (Eco) and enables when plugged (Standard)

### :question: FAQ

#### How do I stop Armory Crate install popup appearing every time I press M4 / Rog key?
Go to BIOS (F2 on boot), open Advanced Settings (F8) and disable "Armory Control Intrerface"  

#### Why Ultimate GPU mode is not available on my laptop?
Ultimate mode is supported (by hardware) only on G14 2022 (and possibly other models from 2022+)

#### App doesn't start / or crashes, what should I do ?
Open "Event Viewer" from start menu, go to Windows Logs -> Application and check for recent Errors mentioning G-Helper. If you see one - please post a [new issue](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper/issues) with all details from this error.

----------------------------

### How to install

1. Download latest release from [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper/releases)
2. Unzip to a folder of your choice
3. Run **GHelper.exe**

### Dependencies

- App requires [.NET7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) to be installed. Most probably you already have it. Otherwise you can [download it](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

- I recommend keeping "Asus Optimization Service" running, as it keeps basic laptop hotkeys such as screen or keyboard brightness adjustment working. If you have (or had) MyASUS app installed, that service is most probably still up and running even after MyASUS uninstalls. It's part of [Asus System Control Interface](https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1047338/). You can install it, and later disable / remove unnecessary services by running [this bat file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seerge/g-helper/main/debloat.bat) as admin.

- It's not recommended to use an app in combination with Armory Crate, cause they adjust the same settings. You can [uninstall it using it's own uninstall tool](https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/14Utilities/Armoury_Crate_Uninstall_Tool.zip?model=armoury%20crate). Just in case, you can always install it back later.

Note: Doesn't need administrator privileges to run!

-------------------------------

Designed and developed for Asus Zephyrus G14 2022 (with AMD Radeon iGPU and dGPU). But could and should potentially work for G14 of 2021 and 2020, G15, X FLOW, and other ROG models for relevant and supported features.

I don't have a Microsoft certificate to sign the app yet, so if you get a warning from Windows Defender on launch (Windows Protected your PC), click More Info -> Run anyway. Alternatively you can compile and run project by yourself using Visual Studio :)

Settings file is stored at ``%AppData%\GHelper``
