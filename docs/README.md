### :rocket: Performance Modes

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://github.com/seerge/g-helper/assets/5920850/3e119674-db8d-486b-aa65-2bf9b61f9aa6">

All Modes are **baked in BIOS** along with default fan curves and power limits and they are the **same** as in the Armoury Crate.

Each BIOS mode is paired with matching Windows Power Mode. You can adjust this setting under ``Fans + Power``

1. **Silent** in BIOS + **Best power efficiency** power mode
2. **Balanced** (Performance in AC) in BIOS  + **Balanced** power mode
3. **Turbo** in BIOS + **Best performance** power mode
   

### :video_game: GPU Modes

1. **Eco** : only low power integrated GPU enabled, iGPU drives built in display
2. **Standard** (MS Hybrid) : iGPU and dGPU enabled, iGPU drives built in display
3. **Ultimate**: iGPU and dGPU enabled, but dGPU drives built in display (supported on 2022+ models)
4. **Optimized**: disables dGPU on battery (Eco) and enables when plugged in (Standard)

## :question: FAQ

#### How do I stop the Armoury Crate install popup appearing every time I press the M4 / Rog key?
Stop ``ArmouryCrateControlInterface`` service under windows Services app or you can stop all asus services from ``Extra`` -> ``Stop services``

#### Battery charge limiter is not working
It could be that Asus services are overwriting this limit after. You may want to stop them by clicking "Stop" in the Asus Services section (under Extra). 
Please note: For some devices not every charge limit % may be working. Try to set standard **80%** to be sure.

####  I don't see GPU modes section 
Some older models (for example G14 2020) don't support disabling GPU on hardware level, therefore GPU section makes no sense for them and will be hidden

#### Why is Ultimate GPU mode not available on my laptop?
Ultimate mode is supported (by hardware) only on 2022+ models

#### Should I apply custom power limits (PPT) and fan curves?
You don't have to, it's purely optional. From my experience built in (in BIOS) performance modes work well. Limit your power or apply custom fan curves only if you have issues. As soon as you click Apply in the ``Fans + Power`` section BIOS will consider your fan curve as "custom"! (no matter if you modified it or not)

#### How does G-helper control my fan speeds?
**It doesn't.** Your BIOS does (same as in case with Armoury). What G-helper can do - is (optionally) set a custom fan profile to current performance mode consisting of 8 pairs of temperature + fan speed % via same endpoint armoury seem to use.

#### How do I change fan % to fan RPM?
Click on them

#### When I try to apply a custom fan curve I get "BIOS rejected fan curve"
TUF models from 2021 and older don't support custom fan curves at all. Most probably you didn't have them in Armoury as well?

#### I don't see a GPU temperature in G-helper
Most probably either you are using Eco / Optimized mode and your dGPU is simply off, or your windows has put the dGPU into sleep to preserve power. 

#### I don't see app after starting it
Please check the system tray for a ``(G)`` icon. By default Windows is keen to hide all icons, so you may need to click ``^`` to see them all. I would advise to right click on Taskbar select TaskBar Settings -> Other System Tray icons -> Mark G-Helper to be always ON.

#### App crashes or doesn't work properly
Open "Event Viewer" from the start menu, go to Windows Logs -> Application and check for recent Errors mentioning G-Helper. If you see one - please post a [new issue](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper/issues) with all details from this error.

#### Can I use MyASUS app along with G-Helper?
You can, the only problem is that MyASUS may override the battery charge limit that you set before. My advice in such a situation would be to set the same limit (i.e. 80%) in both MyASUS and G-Helper.

#### How do I set Mute Microphone to M3?
If you have the Asus Optimization Service running, it's controlled by that service (therefore G-helper doesn't interfere and doesn't touch this function). Alternatively you can stop that service - and you can bind M3 to anything you want.

#### How do I set different "Visual styles"?
Personally, I'm not a big fan of them, as they make colors very inaccurate. But if you want so - you can adjust display colors using either Nvidia Control panel or AMD Adrenaline (appropriate display sections). If you really want you can also use [own ASUS utility from MS Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/gamevisual/9P4K1LFTXSH8?hl=nl-nl&gl=nl&rtc=1)

#### Can I overclock Nvidia GPU core / memory? 
Make sure that your dGPU is enabled (i.e. it's not in Eco mode). Open Fans + Power section and adjust core / memory clock offsets. They work the same as in armoury's manual mode. Please keep in mind that (unfortunately) you need admin permissions for that, and the app will ask you for them. (*)

#### How to Undervolt GPU
Due to the way of how Core Clock offset works for GPU. When you increase clock offset you undervolt it at the same time (see picture)
1. Increase ``Core Clock Offset`` under ``Fans + Power -> GPU`` until your 3dmark / furmark / game runs stable. Start with +100, +150, +200 ... This should make your **scores / fps better within same power** / heat as before.
2. Set ``Core Clock Limit`` to a certain value (it really depends on application / game that you use) **to lower your power** / heat consumption

![Undervolting](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper/assets/5920850/6cadd219-fa92-4260-8bae-cb24c284b8cf)

#### Windows Defender marks app as malware / virus
False positives from Windows Defender (or any other similar system that uses machine learning for detection) is possible as the application is not digitally signed with a certificate. You can always download a version below or compile the app by yourself. All application sources are open and can be monitored from A to Z :)

#### Where can I find app settings or logs ?
You can find them under the ``%AppData%\GHelper`` folder. Please include them when posting a new bug-report or issue.

#### App refuses to run on startup or runs without any icon in tray on startup
Open the app, and uncheck and check again "run on startup". If it still doesn't help (for some reason), you can try to manually edit the "GHelper" task in Windows Task Scheduler, and add a couple of seconds delay to start.

#### How do I uninstall G-helper?
G-helper is a single exe, and it doesn't install anything in the system. To remove it - you can simply delete exe :) If you have applied any custom fan profiles or PPTs - before removing I would recommend selecting your 
favorite performance mode (for example balanced) and clicking "Factory defaults" under Fans + Power.

#### Can I undervolt my CPU ?
Currently you can undervolt AMD CPUs. If your model supports that - you will see an undervolting slider under ``Fans+Power -> Advanced``. If you don't see a slider there, it means your CPU doesn't support undervolting. Full list of models that support that [can be found here](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper/discussions/736)

#### I have G14 2023 and my GPU refuses to disable/enable
It seems to be an issue in older BIOS versions. As [users report](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper/issues/680) - latest BIOS 312 (installable via MyASUS or G-Helper -> Updates) resolves all issues :) So please update.

#### I have G15 2022 and my GPU refuses to disable/enable or my fans misbehave
G15 2022 is known to have a notoriously bugged BIOS (last one 313). Multiple users have reported that problems can be solved by rolling back to a [previous BIOS 311 from Asus Support website](https://rog.asus.com/nl/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g15-2022-series/helpdesk_bios/).

#### I have uninstalled Armoury and my GPU performance is lower than it was
Check your NVidia Experience settings and make sure that you have **Whisper Mode** set to ``OFF``. Also you can go to reset all settings ``Nvidia Control panel -> Manage 3D Settings -> Reset to defaults``

#### How do I do a hardware reset on a laptop?
All Asus laptops have an option to do a hardware reset that can be handy sometimes. It doesn't touch your data, but resets all main hardware-related things (enables your dGPU, wakes up wifi/bt adapter if it hangs for some reason, etc.). 
Turn OFF laptop. Press and hold the "power" button for 30-40 seconds. Then boot normally (it will take a bit longer to boot)

#### What is G-helper ?
Small and lightweight Armoury Crate alternative for Asus laptops offering almost same functionality without extra bloat and unnecessary services. Works on ROG G14, G15, G16, M16, X13, Z13, X16, TUF, Scar, Vivobook, ProArt and all other popular models.

----------------

### How to run

1. Download [**latest release**](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper/releases/latest/download/GHelper.zip)
2. Unzip to a folder of your choice _(don't run exe from zip directly, as windows will put it into temp folder and delete after)_
3. Run **GHelper.exe**

### Requirements (mandatory)

- [Microsoft .NET7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download). Most probably you already have it. Otherwise [download it](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-7.0.202-windows-x64-installer) from the official website.

- [Asus System Control Interface v3+](https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/Image/CustomComponent/ASUSSystemControlInterfaceV3/ASUSSystemControlInterfaceV3.exe). This "driver" from asus should be installed automatically by windows update or along other asus apps. If it's not the case for some reason - you can download and install it manually.

### Recommendations (optional)

- It's **not recommended** to use the app in combination with Armoury Crate services, because they adjust the same settings. You can [uninstall it using AC own uninstall tool](https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/14Utilities/Armoury_Crate_Uninstall_Tool.zip?model=armoury%20crate). Just in case, you can always install it back later.

- It's **not recommended** to have "ASUS Smart Display Control" app running, as it will try to change refresh rates and fight with g-helper for the same function. You can safely uninstall it.

- You can stop / disable unnecessary services: Go to **Extra** in the app, and press "Stop" in Asus Services section (former **[debloat.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seerge/g-helper/main/debloat.bat)**). To start / enable services back - click "Start" instead (former **[bloat.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seerge/g-helper/main/bloat.bat)**)

- It is **strongly recommended** to run app with windows default "balanced" power plan

-------------------------------

## Notice for G14 2023 users who complain about not being able to set Eco mode

This is a known issue with the Nvidia Drivers / Windows that occurs if you shutdown or restart a system with dGPU disabled (Eco mode). This situation can happen for **BOTH Armoury Crate and G-Helper** (as it doesn't depend on them in a first place)  

Scenario to reproduce (for both AC / GH):
1. Set Eco mode and shutdown / start or reboot your computer
2. After booting in Eco set Standard -> ``brightness controls won't work``
3. Try to set Eco mode -> ``it won't work``
4. G-Helper would offer you to restart GPU in Device Manager, after that you will be able to set Eco, AC won't be able to do anything

To prevent this from happening, G-Helper by default would try to enable dGPU before shutdown / restart. 
If you want to turn this feature off uncheck ``Extra`` -> ``Enable GPU on shutdown (prevents issue with Eco mode)``

-------------------------------

I don't have a Microsoft certificate to sign the app yet, so if you get a warning from Windows Defender on launch (Windows Protected your PC), click More Info -> Run anyway. 

------------------

## Power user settings

GENERAL NOTE: "Power user" settings require editing config located at ``%AppData%\GHelper\config.json``. 

- Quit G-Helper
- Make your changes / additions co ``config.json``
- Start G-Helper again

_Make sure to keep json structure (i.e. not to break it with extra or missing commas, etc.) or the app will fail to read it and will just recreate an empty config instead._

### Manual app language setting

By default the app will use your windows language setting. But you can set language manually (if it supported of course)

```
"language" : "en",
``` 
(by replacing "en" with language of your choice)

### Custom windows power plans with each mode

You can manually assign a custom power plan GUID to each mode. 

Format is following : ``"scheme_<mode>" : "GUID" ``
Where ``mode = 0 (balanced), 1 (turbo), 2 (silent)``

Example (for default windows "balanced" power plan):
```
"scheme_0": "381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e",
"scheme_1": "381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e",
"scheme_2": "381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e",
```

### Alternative Activation for XG Mobile 6850XT
If you experience situation when your XG Mobile doesn't work on full power when Activated. It's possible it needs "alternative" command to get activated. 
To turn it on, add following line to config :
```
"xgm_special" : 1,
```

### Override UI theme

By default app would set UI theme from "app" theme in windows setting. You can override it to specific theme, or general windows theme

```
"ui_mode" : "dark",
"ui_mode" : "light",
"ui_mode" : "windows",
```

### Skip keyboard Aura initialisation on startup
By default app would set last remembered RGB mode for keyboard on each launch. To disable it completely 

```
"skip_aura" : 1,
````

### Disable OSD
Disable app's OSD (for performance modes, keyboard backlight, etc.) 
```
"disable_osd": 1,
```

### Extra Keybindings 
- ``Ctrl + Shift + F5`` - Toggle Performance Modes
- ``Ctrl + Shift + F12`` - Open G-Helper window 
- ``Ctrl + M1 / M2`` - Screen brightness Down / Up
- ``Shift + M1 / M2`` - Backlight brightness Down / Up

If you don't want this bindings to work you can add 
```
"skip_hotkeys":1,
``` 

### Toggle Performance Mode key binding

To change binding for Toggle Performance Modes to ``Ctrl + Shift + KEY``

```
"keybind_profile": 116,
``` 

Where 116 is [numerical code for desired key](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-dhtml/9780596514082/apb.html). Put 0 to completely disable this binding.


### Higher Maximum GPU Clock / Memory Offsets

By default under GPU section you can set up to +250/+250 for Core and Memory Clock Offset. To increase this value:
```
  "max_gpu_core": 300,
  "max_gpu_memory": 1500,
```

### Custom hotkey actions

Select ``Custom`` next to appropriate hotkey under ``Extra`` settings and do one of the following:

1. To run any custom application - put a full path to exe into "action" text field, for example:
``C:\Program Files\EA Games\Battlefield 2042\BF2042.exe``

2. To simulate any windows key - put appropriate keycode into the "action" field, for example ``0x2C`` for Print Screen.
