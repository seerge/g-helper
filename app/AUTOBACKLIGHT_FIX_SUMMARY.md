# Auto Backlight Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The laptop keyboard backlight was not responding to ambient light changes due to several issues in the auto backlight implementation:

1. **Incorrect sensor detection**: The ambient light sensor detection logic was using wrong WMI queries
2. **Poor fallback simulation**: Time-based simulation was too simplistic and didn't provide realistic light level changes
3. **Initialization issues**: Auto backlight controller wasn't being properly initialized in all code paths
4. **Syntax errors**: C# switch statement syntax issues preventing compilation

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Ambient Light Sensor (`Helpers/AmbientLightSensor.cs`)
- **Improved sensor detection**: Added multiple detection methods including proper Windows Sensor API queries
- **Enhanced WMI queries**: Now checks for HID sensor devices and uses correct GUID for ambient light sensors  
- **Better screen brightness proxy**: Uses monitor brightness as a more reliable indicator of ambient conditions
- **Realistic time-based simulation**: Implemented sophisticated day/night cycle with dawn/dusk transitions
- **Better error handling**: More robust exception handling and logging

### 2. Enhanced Auto Backlight Controller (`Input/AutoBacklightController.cs`)
- **Improved initialization**: More robust error handling during sensor initialization
- **Default configuration**: Automatically sets sensible default values for all configuration parameters
- **Better backlight adjustment logic**: Added early returns to avoid unnecessary processing
- **Enhanced logging**: Better debug information for troubleshooting

### 3. Fixed Input Dispatcher Integration (`Input/InputDispatcher.cs`)
- **Proper initialization**: Ensures auto backlight controller is initialized in all code paths
- **Fixed syntax errors**: Corrected C# switch statement syntax for multiple case values
- **Added manual trigger**: New method to manually test auto backlight functionality
- **Enhanced hotkey support**: Added support for both toggle and test actions

## Configuration Options

### Basic Settings
```
auto_backlight_enabled = 1      // Enable auto backlight (0=off, 1=on)
als_dark_threshold = 50         // Lux below which backlight turns on
als_bright_threshold = 100      // Lux above which backlight turns off
als_hysteresis = 10            // Prevents rapid on/off switching
```

### Backlight Levels
```
als_min_backlight = 1          // Minimum backlight level (1-3)
als_max_backlight = 3          // Maximum backlight level (1-3)
```

### Timing Settings
```
als_poll_interval = 2000       // Sensor check interval (milliseconds)
als_input_delay = 10000        // Delay after user input before resuming auto control
```

### Optional Settings
```
als_show_notifications = 1     // Show toast notifications for auto adjustments
```

## How to Use

### 1. Enable Auto Backlight
The feature can be enabled through configuration or hotkey:
- Set `auto_backlight_enabled = 1` in config
- Or bind a hotkey to `auto_backlight` action

### 2. Hotkey Bindings
Add these to your configuration for easy access:
```
m3 = "auto_backlight"          // Toggle auto backlight on/off
m4 = "auto_backlight_test"     // Manual test trigger
```

### 3. Adjust Sensitivity
- **More sensitive**: Lower `als_dark_threshold` (e.g., 30)
- **Less sensitive**: Higher `als_dark_threshold` (e.g., 80)
- **Prevent flickering**: Increase `als_hysteresis` (e.g., 20)

### 4. Monitor Operation
Check the logs for messages like:
```
Auto backlight controller initialized successfully
Ambient light sensor availability: true/false
Light level changed: 45 → 120 lux
Auto backlight: 0 → 2 (ALS (45 lux))
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Hardware Sensor Detected
If no ambient light sensor is found, the system will use time-based simulation:
- 6:00-20:00: Daytime (high lux, backlight off)
- 20:00-6:00: Nighttime (low lux, backlight on)

### Backlight Not Changing
1. Check if auto backlight is enabled: Look for "Auto backlight controller enabled" in logs
2. Verify current light level: Use the test hotkey to see current lux value
3. Adjust thresholds: Fine-tune `als_dark_threshold` and `als_bright_threshold`
4. Check user input delay: Recent keyboard/mouse activity pauses auto control

### Testing
Use the manual test trigger (`auto_backlight_test` action) to:
- Check current ambient light level
- Verify system is responding
- Debug threshold settings

## Technical Details

### Sensor Detection Methods
1. **WMI Monitor Brightness**: Uses screen brightness as ambient light proxy
2. **ACPI Light Sensors**: Searches for hardware ambient light sensors
3. **HID Sensor Devices**: Checks for HIDSensorV2 and SensorsAlsDriver
4. **Time-based Fallback**: Sophisticated day/night simulation when no hardware available

### Decision Logic
```
if (lux ≤ dark_threshold - hysteresis) → Turn backlight ON
if (lux ≥ bright_threshold + hysteresis) → Turn backlight OFF
if (between thresholds) → No change (hysteresis zone)
```

### User Input Handling
- Tracks keyboard/mouse input to avoid conflicts with manual control
- Configurable delay (default 10 seconds) before resuming auto control
- Manual backlight changes immediately pause auto control

This fix provides a robust, configurable automatic backlight system that works both with hardware ambient light sensors and time-based simulation for maximum compatibility.
